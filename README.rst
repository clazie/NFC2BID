        NFC2BID
=========================

This project is based on a project from Rainer Kemb√ºgler ("onki") from  02. Dezember 2016 
(seen here: `https://onki.de/uebermich/bauberichte/289-bid2nfc-einbau-ins-ladegeraet <https://onki.de/uebermich/bauberichte/289-bid2nfc-einbau-ins-ladegeraet>`_ )

Information can also found here: `https://www.rc-network.de/threads/bid2nfc-als-nachr%C3%BCstl%C3%B6sung.587281/ <https://www.rc-network.de/threads/bid2nfc-als-nachr%C3%BCstl%C3%B6sung.587281/>`_

I collected all informations necessary to build it by my own and refactored the firmware for 
using it with PlatformIO.
